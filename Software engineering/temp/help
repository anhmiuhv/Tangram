There are 3 types of levels, puzzle level, lightning level and release level.
Your goal is basically cover the board with pieces in bulpen.
1.In puzzle level, you have limited moves.
2.In lightning level, you have limited time and piece on board can not be moved.
3.In release level, your pieces may not be enough to cover the whole board, you 
should try covering all numbers instead.(Pieces on Board can not moved) 
P.S. You can move piece from board to bullpen but only in puzzle level.
